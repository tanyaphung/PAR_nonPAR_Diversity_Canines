PIPELINE
Contrasting diversity pattern between autosomes, pseudoautosomal regions and nonpseudoautosomal regions of the X chromosome

Pipeline:

I. Process variants (numerator)
1. 
What: Single sample variant calling with GATK
Script: gatk_single_sample.sh

2. 
What: Merge all of the vcf from 20 individuals into one vcf
Script: merge_vcfs.sh

3. 
What: Filter variants: GATK hard filter, remove nonbiallelic variants and clustered SNPs
Script: filter_vcfs.sh

4. 
What: Obtain GT for each individual
Script: obtain_GT_for_1_ind_from_VCF.sh


II. Process callable loci (denominator)
5. 
What: Use GATK to obtain the callable loci from BAM file
Script: obtain_callable_loci.sh

6. 
What: Format callable loci
Script: format_callable_loci.sh

III. Obtain putatively neutral regions

7. 
What: Obtain putatively neutral regions by using bedtools
Script: obtain_neutralReions.sh [NOTE: currently only deal with Ensemble genes and repetitive elements]

8.
What: For each individual, intersect the callable regions with the putatively neutral regions
Script: intersect_callableRegions_neutralRegions.sh

IV. Make non-overlapping windows:
9. 
What: generate non-overlapping windows
Script: 

V. Compute per individual heterozygosity
1.
